# Dashboard for ASP.NET Core - How to Calculate the Viewer's Layout Size based on the Dashboard Size

This example shows how to set the control in Viewer mode to the same size as the dashboard and display only one scroll bar on the page. 

You can open the control in Designer mode to resize the dashboard. In this mode, the control occupies the HTML page's visible area.

When you change the size in Designer mode, switch the control to Viewer mode to make the size of the control the same as the dashboard.
